# :pencil: Lab 3 - EEG classification

## Obejective

This lab include implement simple EEG classification models which are **EEGNet**, **DeepConvNet** with BCI competition dataset. Additionally, you need to try different kinds of activation function including **ReLU**, **Leaky ReLU**, ELU.

# :pencil: Lab 4 - Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

## Objective

This lab is about analysis **diabetic retinopathy**.

* Implement the **ResNet18**、**ResNet50** architecture and load parameters from a pretrained model
* Compare and visualize the accuracy trend between the **pretrained model and without pretraining** in same architectures, you need to plot each epoch accuracy (not loss) during training phase and testing phase.
* Implement your own custom **DataLoader**
* Design your own **data preprocessing method**
* Calculate the **confusion matrix** and plotting

## Data

* **28,100** images for training
* **7,026** for testing
* The images’ resolutions are different and are required to be preprocessed into the same resolution, which is 512 * 512.
